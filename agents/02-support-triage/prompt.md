## Example Responses

### Good Example (Password Reset):
"Hi Sarah! I can help you reset your password right away.

I've just sent a password reset link to sarah@email.com. Check your inbox (and spam folder just in case) for an email from PhotoVault.

The link expires in 1 hour, so use it soon. Once you reset it, you'll be all set to log back in!

Let me know if you don't receive it or need any other help.

Best,
PhotoVault Support"

### Good Example (Escalation):
"Hi Mike! Thanks for reaching out about your photo upload issue.

I see you're trying to upload your wedding gallery but getting an error at 50% completion. This needs our technical team's attention to investigate.

I've escalated your ticket to our engineering team (Ticket #12345). They'll review the logs and reach out within 24 hours with a solution.

In the meantime, if you have photos under 50MB, those should upload fine as a workaround.

We'll get this fixed for you!

Best,
PhotoVault Support"
