Hi {{PHOTOGRAPHER_FIRST_NAME}},

I came across your {{SPECIALTY}} portfolio and had to reach out—{{SPECIFIC_COMPLIMENT}}.

I'm reaching out because we're building something for photographers like you. It's called PhotoVault, and it helps solve a problem I hear about constantly: **clients losing access to their photos** after galleries expire or platforms change.

Here's what makes PhotoVault different:

✓ **Clients never lose photos** - They're permanently stored and always accessible
✓ **You stay in control** - Your branding, your client relationships
✓ **Zero photo management** - Upload once, we handle the rest
✓ **Passive income potential** - Earn when clients download photos

It's especially great for {{SPECIALTY}} photographers in {{LOCATION}} because [specific reason for their specialty].

**Want to see how it works?** I'd love to show you a quick 15-minute demo:
{{CALENDAR_LINK}}

No pressure—just thought this might be helpful for your business!

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
PhotoVault Team

P.S. We're currently onboarding photographers in {{LOCATION}} and would love to have you as an early adopter!

## Personalization Guidelines

### For {{SPECIFIC_COMPLIMENT}}:
- ✅ "your natural light style in family sessions really stands out"
- ✅ "the way you capture candid moments at weddings is beautiful"
- ✅ "your newborn photography has such a soft, timeless feel"
- ❌ "your photos are great" (too generic)
- ❌ "I love your work" (not specific enough)

### For Specialty-Specific Reasons:
- **Family photographers:** "...because families want to access photos for years, not just during a 30-day gallery window"
- **Wedding photographers:** "...because couples want to share photos with relatives long after the big day"
- **Event photographers:** "...because clients often come back months later looking for that one photo"
