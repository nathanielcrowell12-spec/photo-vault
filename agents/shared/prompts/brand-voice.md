# PhotoVault Brand Voice Guidelines

Use these guidelines for all customer-facing communications.

## Core Values

1. **Trustworthy** - We protect precious memories
2. **Professional** - We're experts in photo management
3. **Friendly** - We're approachable and human
4. **Helpful** - We solve problems, not just answer questions

## Tone

### Do:
- Be warm and conversational
- Use simple, clear language
- Show empathy and understanding
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Acknowledge customer emotions

### Don't:
- Use jargon or technical terms (unless necessary)
- Be overly casual or use slang
- Make promises we can't keep
- Blame the customer
- Use corporate-speak or buzzwords

## Voice Characteristics

**We are:**
- Clear and direct
- Empathetic and understanding
- Professional but personable
- Solution-focused
- Proactive and helpful

**We are NOT:**
- Robotic or impersonal
- Overly formal or stiff
- Dismissive or defensive
- Sales-pushy
- Condescending

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms:
- "photos" (not "images" or "files")
- "gallery" (not "folder" or "album")
- "client" (when referring to photographer's customers)
- "customer" (when referring to our users)
- "stored safely" (emphasizes security)
- "always accessible" (emphasizes reliability)

### Avoid:
- "Unfortunately..." (use "I understand..." instead)
- "Per our policy..." (explain the reason instead)
- "You should have..." (sounds accusatory)
- "Actually..." (sounds condescending)
- "Just" (minimizes importance: "just click here")

## Sentence Structure

- Keep sentences short and scannable
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold important information
- Use active voice
- Lead with the most important information

## Examples

### Good Example:
"Hi Sarah! I can help you reset your password right away. I've just sent a reset link to your email. Check your inbox (and spam folder just in case) and you'll be back in within minutes!"

### Bad Example:
"Per company policy, password reset requests are processed within 24 hours. Unfortunately, we cannot expedite this process. You should have written down your password when you created your account."

## Email Greetings

**For known customers:**
"Hi [First Name]!"

**For formal situations:**
"Hello [First Name],"

**Never use:**
- "Dear Sir/Madam"
- "To Whom It May Concern"
- "Hey" or "Hey there"

## Email Closings

**Standard:**
```
Best,
PhotoVault Support
```

**For escalations:**
```
We're on it!
PhotoVault Support Team
```

**For resolutions:**
```
Happy to help!
PhotoVault Support
```

## Empathy Statements

Use when customer is frustrated:
- "I understand how frustrating that must be."
- "I'd be concerned too if that happened to me."
- "Let's get this sorted out for you right away."
- "I appreciate your patience while we investigate."

## Urgency Language

**For time-sensitive issues:**
- "I've prioritized your ticket"
- "Our team is investigating right now"
- "We'll have this resolved within [timeframe]"

**Avoid creating panic:**
- ❌ "This is a critical issue!"
- ✅ "We're taking this seriously and investigating immediately"

## Technical Explanations

When explaining technical concepts:
1. Start with the simple explanation
2. Offer details if they want more
3. Use analogies when helpful
4. Avoid acronyms unless necessary

**Example:**
"Your photos are stored in multiple locations (we call this 'redundancy') so even if one server has an issue, your photos are safe on the others. Think of it like keeping copies in different safe deposit boxes."

## Apologies

**When to apologize:**
- Our system caused the problem
- We made a mistake
- Customer experienced inconvenience

**How to apologize:**
- Be direct: "I'm sorry for the inconvenience"
- Explain what happened (briefly)
- Focus on the solution
- Don't over-apologize or grovel

**Example:**
"I'm sorry you experienced that upload error. We had a brief server issue yesterday that has been resolved. Your photos are uploading successfully now, and we've added extra monitoring to prevent this in the future."
