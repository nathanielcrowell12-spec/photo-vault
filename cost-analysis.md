## Cost Breakdown: What Does It Actually Cost?

### 1. Storage Costs (AWS S3 via Supabase)

#### Industry Standard Gallery Sizes:
- **Wedding Photography:** 400-800 photos, ~5-15 GB (high-res JPEGs)
- **Family Session:** 50-150 photos, ~1-3 GB
- **Newborn Session:** 100-300 photos, ~2-5 GB
- **Average per gallery:** ~5 GB
- **Average galleries per customer:** 3-5 galleries (multi-photographer network)
- **Average total per customer:** 15-25 GB

#### AWS S3 Standard Pricing (2024):
- **Storage:** $0.023 per GB/month (first 50 TB)
- **Data transfer OUT:** $0.09 per GB (downloads)
- **PUT requests:** $0.005 per 1,000 requests

#### Cost Per Customer (Conservative Estimate):

**Scenario A: Average Customer (20 GB, moderate usage)**
```
Storage: 20 GB Ã— $0.023 = $0.46/month
Bandwidth (10% monthly downloads): 2 GB Ã— $0.09 = $0.18/month
API requests (uploads/views): ~$0.01/month
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total Storage Cost: ~$0.65/month per customer
```

**Scenario B: Heavy User (50 GB, high usage)**
```
Storage: 50 GB Ã— $0.023 = $1.15/month
Bandwidth (20% downloads): 10 GB Ã— $0.09 = $0.90/month
API requests: ~$0.05/month
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total Storage Cost: ~$2.10/month per customer
```

### 2. Infrastructure Costs (Supabase/Hosting)

#### Supabase Pricing Tiers:
- **Free Tier:** Up to 500 MB database, 1 GB file storage (not viable)
- **Pro Tier:** $25/month
  - 8 GB database
  - 100 GB file storage
  - 250 GB bandwidth
  
- **Team Tier:** $599/month
  - Unlimited database
  - Unlimited storage
  - Unlimited bandwidth

#### Cost Per Customer:

**At Scale (1,000 customers on Team plan):**
```
Supabase: $599/month Ã· 1,000 customers = $0.60/customer
```

**At Small Scale (100 customers on Pro plan):**
```
Supabase: $25/month Ã· 100 customers = $0.25/customer
(Plus overages if you exceed 100 GB storage or 250 GB bandwidth)
```

### 3. Additional Costs Per Customer

#### Payment Processing (Stripe):
```
Stripe fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Storage Costs Exceed Revenue
**Problem:** Heavy users (50+ GB) cost $2.10+ in storage alone

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Storage Limits:** Cap free storage at 30 GB, charge for overages
2. **Compression:** Automatically compress photos (quality vs size tradeoff)
3. **Tiered Pricing:** Offer "Premium" tier for unlimited storage
4. **Archive Old Photos:** Move old galleries to cheaper cold storage (S3 Glacier)

### Risk 2: High Bandwidth Costs (Lots of Downloads)
**Problem:** If customers download entire galleries monthly, bandwidth costs spike

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Download Limits:** 3-5 full gallery downloads per month
2. **Streaming:** Encourage viewing vs downloading
3. **Selective Downloads:** Download individual photos, not entire galleries
4. **Bandwidth Pooling:** Heavy users subsidized by light users

### Risk 3: Low Customer Retention
**Problem:** If customers cancel after 1-2 years, you lose recurring revenue

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Memory Features:** Annual highlight reels keep them engaged
2. **Multi-Photographer Value:** More galleries = more value
3. **Family Sharing:** Get entire family invested
4. **Mobile App:** Make it sticky with daily use

---

## Recommendations

### âœ… $8/Month is Viable IF:

1. **You Hit Volume:** Need 500+ customers to be meaningfully profitable
2. **You Control Costs:** 
   - Use storage optimization (compression, limits)
   - Efficient CDN usage
   - Automated support systems
3. **You Drive Value:**
   - Multi-photographer galleries
   - Memory features
   - High retention

### ðŸš¨ Watch Out For:

1. **Power Users:** 10% of customers may use 50%+ of storage
2. **Bandwidth Spikes:** Viral gallery sharing could spike costs
3. **Growth Scaling:** Need to reach 340+ customers to cover fixed costs

### ðŸ’¡ Pricing Alternatives to Consider:

#### Option A: Keep $8/month, Add Tiers
```
Basic: $8/month (30 GB limit, 3 galleries)
Plus: $15/month (100 GB, unlimited galleries)
Premium: $25/month (unlimited storage)
```

#### Option B: Increase to $10/month
```
Customer pays: $10/month
Photographer gets: $5/month (same 50%)
You keep: $5/month
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Extra profit: +$1/month per customer
At 1,000 customers: +$12,000/year more profit
```

#### Option C: Dynamic Pricing Based on Storage
```
Base: $8/month (up to 25 GB)
+$1 per 10 GB over base
Heavy users pay more, subsidize average users
```

---

## Final Verdict

### âœ… YES, $8/month Works

**At 1,000 active customers:**
- Revenue: $4,000/month from your 50%
- Costs: ~$2,500/month
- **Profit: ~$1,500/month ($18,000/year)**
- **Profit margin: 37-40%**

**At 5,000 customers:**
- Revenue: $20,000/month
- Costs: ~$11,000/month
- **Profit: ~$9,000/month ($108,000/year)**
- **Profit margin: 45%**

### ðŸŽ¯ Keys to Success:

1. **Reach 500-1,000 customers quickly** (break-even at ~340)
2. **Implement storage optimization** (compression, limits)
3. **Focus on retention** (multi-photographer value, memory features)
4. **Monitor heavy users** (consider tiered pricing if needed)
5. **Leverage photographer network** (they bring customers, you keep costs low)

### ðŸ’° The Math Works Because:

1. **Storage is cheap:** $0.023/GB = $0.46 for 20 GB
2. **Infrastructure scales:** $599/month supports 1,000+ customers
3. **Photographer commission is revenue share:** You only pay when you earn
4. **Multi-photographer model:** Customers with 5+ galleries still cost ~$1-2/month to serve

**Your $4/month keeps $2-2.50 profit after costs = 50-62% margin**

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (MVP):
1. âœ… Keep $8/month pricing
2. âœ… Monitor storage per customer
3. âœ… Set soft limit alerts at 30 GB per customer
4. âœ… Implement image compression on upload

### After 1,000 Customers:
1. Review actual storage costs
2. Consider tiered pricing if needed
3. Evaluate $10/month pricing test
4. Implement cold storage for old galleries

### Long-Term:
1. Negotiate enterprise Supabase pricing
2. Direct AWS contract (cheaper than Supabase)
3. Tiered pricing based on usage
4. Premium features for upsell

---

## Competitor Comparison

### What Others Charge:

**Pixieset:**
- Photographer pays: $0-40/month
- Customer: Gallery expires unless photographer pays

**SmugMug:**
- Photographer pays: $55-90/year
- Customer: No direct fee

**ShootProof:**
- Photographer pays: $10-35/month
- Customer: No direct fee

**Your Model:**
- Photographer pays: $22/month + earns $4/month per client
- Customer: $8/month (with first year included)

**Your advantage:** Customer pays directly, photographer earns commission. This is unique in the market.

---

## The Verdict: Sustainable? YES âœ…

**Why it works:**
1. Storage is incredibly cheap ($0.46 for 20 GB)
2. Infrastructure costs are fixed (doesn't scale linearly)
3. You have 50% gross margins before any optimization
4. Volume makes it highly profitable (1,000+ customers)

**Watch out for:**
1. Power users (1-2% may use 50+ GB)
2. Bandwidth spikes from viral sharing
3. Need to reach critical mass (500+ customers)

**Recommendation:** Stick with $8/month for MVP, monitor costs closely, optimize storage, and consider tiered pricing once you hit 2,000+ customers.
