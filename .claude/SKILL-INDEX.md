# SKILL-INDEX.md - REDIRECT

**This file has moved.**

The single source of truth for the PhotoVault Skill Index is now:

```
Stone-Fence-Brain/VENTURES/PhotoVault/claude/SKILL-INDEX.md
```

**Full path:** `C:\Users\natha\Stone-Fence-Brain\VENTURES\PhotoVault\claude\SKILL-INDEX.md`

---

## Why?

- Skills are created and maintained in Stone-Fence-Brain (by Claude Desktop or Claude Code)
- All Claude instances read from the same source when working on PhotoVault
- Single source of truth eliminates sync issues

**Go read that file instead.**
