## üîß Pixieset Auto-Import (In Progress)

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Framework built
- ‚úÖ API route created
- ‚úÖ URL parsing works
- ‚è≥ Needs Pixieset API implementation

### To Complete Pixieset Import:

#### Option A: Official Pixieset API
Research shows Pixieset has an unofficial Gallery API:
- **Base URL**: `https://galleries.pixieset.com/api/v1`
- **Authentication**: Session-based with cookies
- **Endpoints**: Gallery info, photo list, download URLs

**Next Steps**:
1. Test Pixieset API authentication
2. Implement photo listing endpoint
3. Download photos from Pixieset
4. Upload to Supabase Storage
5. Generate thumbnails
6. Update database

#### Option B: Web Scraping (Backup)
If API doesn't work:
1. Use Puppeteer/Playwright
2. Simulate browser login
3. Scrape photo URLs
4. Download and upload

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours development + testing
