# Pixieset Date Extraction - Analysis

## Current Status

### Scraping Attempt Results:
- ❌ **Direct HTTP Request Failed**: Got 403 (Forbidden) with "Just a moment..." 
- **Reason**: Pixieset uses Cloudflare protection to prevent scraping
- **Response**: Can't access the gallery page without a real browser

## Available Options

### Option 1: Pixieset API (Unofficial) ⭐ BEST
**Pros:**
- Most reliable
- Can get gallery metadata including dates
- Can authenticate with password
- Access to full gallery data

**Cons:**
- Requires reverse-engineering Pixieset's API
- May break if they change it

**Implementation:**
1. Authenticate with gallery URL + password
2. Get gallery metadata (publish date, photo count, etc.)
3. Get photo list with dates
4. Download photos

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### Option 2: Browser Automation (Puppeteer/Playwright)
**Pros:**
- Can bypass Cloudflare
- Can enter password automatically
- Can extract any visible data

**Cons:**
- Slower than API
- Requires headless browser
- More complex to maintain

**Implementation:**
1. Launch headless Chrome
2. Navigate to gallery URL
3. Enter password
4. Extract dates from page
5. Scrape photo URLs

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

---

### Option 3: Manual Date Entry
**Pros:**
- Simple, immediate
- User knows the date

**Cons:**
- Manual work required
- Less automated

**Implementation:**
1. Add "Edit Gallery" feature
2. Let user manually enter photoshoot date
3. Save to database

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Option 4: EXIF Data from Photos (When Imported) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Most accurate (actual photo capture date)
- Automatic once photos are imported
- No scraping needed

**Cons:**
- Only works after photos are imported
- Requires photo download

**Implementation:**
1. Import photos (manual upload or auto-import)
2. Extract EXIF data from each photo
3. Find earliest date = photoshoot date
4. Update gallery session_date

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours (already part of import feature)

---

## Recommended Approach

### **Hybrid Solution**: Option 4 + Option 3

**Phase 1: Immediate (30 min)**
- Add "Edit Gallery" button
- Let you manually enter photoshoot date
- Simple form to update session_date

**Phase 2: When Importing (2 hours)**
- Extract EXIF data from photos
- Auto-detect photoshoot date
- Update gallery automatically

**Phase 3: Future (4-6 hours)**
- Build full Pixieset API integration
- Auto-import with all metadata
- Get publish dates, photo dates, everything

## What We Know Now

### From Your Gallery:
- **Gallery Name**: "Crowell Country Living"
- **Photographer**: Meadow Lane Media
- **Photo Count**: 150 photos (from URL)
- **Gallery URL**: meadowlanemedia.pixieset.com/crowellcountryliving
- **Access**: Password protected (password: crowell)

### What We DON'T Know (Yet):
- ❓ When gallery was published on Pixieset
- ❓ When photos were taken
- ❓ When photos were uploaded

### How to Get These:
1. **Gallery publish date**: Need Pixieset API or browser automation
2. **Photo taken dates**: EXIF data from photos (when imported)
3. **Photo upload dates**: Pixieset API (if they provide it)

---

## Immediate Action

**I can build the "Edit Gallery" feature right now (30 minutes):**

This would let you:
1. Click "Edit" on gallery card
2. Enter photoshoot date manually
3. Add notes/description
4. Save changes
5. Gallery shows correct date

**Then later**, when we import photos, we can auto-update the date from EXIF data.

## Your Decision

**Which approach do you want?**

**A. Quick Fix** (30 min) ✅ FASTEST
- Add manual date entry
- You type in the date
- Gallery shows correct date immediately

**B. Browser Automation** (3-4 hours)
- Build Puppeteer scraper
- Auto-login with password
- Extract dates from Pixieset page

**C. Pixieset API** (4-6 hours) ⭐ BEST LONG-TERM
- Reverse-engineer Pixieset API
- Full auto-import with metadata
- Most reliable solution

**D. Wait for Photo Import** (2 hours)
- Import photos first (manual or auto)
- Extract EXIF dates from photos
- Auto-update gallery date

---

**My Recommendation**: 
Start with **Option A** (30 min) so you have the right date now, then build **Option C or D** for automatic date detection in the future.
