## üí° WHY WE NEED STRIPE

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **Client Subscriptions**: $100 first year, then $8/month
2. **Photographer Subscriptions**: $22/month
3. **Commission System**: 50% of client fees go to photographers

**Example Monthly Revenue (100 photographers, 1000 clients):**
- Photographers: 100 √ó $22 = $2,200/mo
- Clients (after year 1): 1000 √ó $8 √ó 50% = $4,000/mo (you keep half)
- **Total PhotoVault Revenue**: $6,200/mo

**That's why this is Priority #1!** üöÄ

## üîê SECURITY NOTES

- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in .gitignore)
- ‚úÖ Use Test Mode keys for development
- ‚úÖ Only switch to Live Mode when ready to go live
- ‚úÖ Webhook secret validates Stripe is really sending the events
- ‚úÖ Service role key is needed for database updates from webhooks
