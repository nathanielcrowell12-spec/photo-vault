            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                PhotoVault offers an optional Family Sharing feature that allows you to give family members access to view and download photos in your galleries. This feature is designed to help families preserve and share precious memories together, making it easy for multiple generations to access and enjoy your family's photo collection.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#1A2B4A] mb-3 mt-6">5.2 Access Levels</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When you enable Family Sharing, you can grant access at the following levels:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Account Owner:</strong> Full administrative control, billing management, ability to authorize family members, create/delete galleries</li>
                <li><strong>Family Admin:</strong> Can view and download all shared photos, add photos to shared galleries, invite additional family members (with Owner approval)</li>
                <li><strong>Family Viewer:</strong> Can view and download shared photos only</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#1A2B4A] mb-3 mt-6">5.3 Platform Philosophy: Designed for Family Memories</h3>
            <div class="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-5 mb-6">
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    <strong>PhotoVault is designed for family memories.</strong> We built Family Sharing to make it effortless for families to preserve and access their shared photo history across generations. When grandparents, parents, and children can all access the same family photos, those memories stay alive and connected.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    <strong>This means you should think carefully about what you upload.</strong> Photos stored in galleries with Family Sharing enabled may be accessible to the family members you authorize. Do not upload sensitive, private, or confidential images that you would not want your authorized family members to access.

                    <strong>By enabling the Family Sharing feature, you consent to authorized family members having access to view and download photos in your shared galleries.</strong> If you require private, individual-only storage, we recommend keeping Family Sharing disabled or using a separate gallery that is not shared.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Family Sharing is not appropriate for:
