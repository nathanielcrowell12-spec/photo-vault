# PhotoVault

> Memory Insurance for families. Passive income for photographers.

PhotoVault is a photo storage platform with two sides:

1. **For Families**: Permanent storage for professional photos. No more expiring gallery links or lost hard drives. One tap to download any photo to your camera roll.

2. **For Photographers**: Replace Pixieset, ShootProof, SmugMug. Deliver galleries to clients and earn $4/month passive income per family—forever.

## The Memory Insurance Model

Professional photos cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to create. Wedding photos, newborns, family portraits—these are irreplaceable. PhotoVault protects them for $8/month.

- Hard drives fail (100% failure rate, eventually)
- Cloud storage policies change (Google Photos 2021)
- Gallery links expire (most photographer platforms: 1 year)
- PhotoVault: permanent access, professional-grade protection
