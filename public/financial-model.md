## Additional Revenue Opportunities

### Cross-Photographer Commission Reset
When an inactive client books a new session with a different photographer:
- **New photographer gets:** $50 (new customer commission)
- **PhotoVault gets:** $50 (from $100 upfront payment)
- **Original photographer keeps:** $4/month recurring (passive income)

**Impact on 500 photographers with 10% cross-photographer activity:**
- 7,000 clients × 10% = 700 cross-photographer sessions per year
- **Additional revenue:** 700 × $50 = $35,000/year

### Inactive Client Reactivation
Clients who reactivate after 6+ months of inactivity:
- **PhotoVault keeps 100%:** $8/month per reactivated client
- No photographer commission on reactivated galleries

**Impact on 500 photographers with 15% inactivity rate:**
- 7,000 clients × 15% = 1,050 inactive clients
- 50% reactivation rate = 525 reactivated clients
- **Additional revenue:** 525 × $8/month = $4,200/month = $50,400/year
