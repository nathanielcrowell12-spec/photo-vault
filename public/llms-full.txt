# PhotoVault - Full Context for AI Agents

> The Anti-Yelp for photographers: verified permit requirements, real costs, and insider tips for Wisconsin photography locations.

PhotoVault solves two problems:

1. **For Photographers**: Finding accurate permit requirements, costs, and rules for photo shoot locations is scattered across venue websites, city PDFs, and Reddit threads. We aggregate and verify it.

2. **For Families**: Professional photos get lost when cloud storage expires or hard drives fail. PhotoVault is "Memory Insurance"—permanent storage managed by their photographer.

**The Location Directory (Our SEO Focus)**

Photographers search for specific location information before every shoot:
- "Do I need a permit at Olbrich Botanical Gardens?"
- "How much does a Capitol building photo permit cost?"
- "When do sunflowers bloom at Pope Farm?"

This information is fragmented and unreliable elsewhere. We verify and structure it.

**The Madison Model Taxonomy**

Every location in our directory includes:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Permit Status | Whether permits are required | "Required for professional sessions" |
| Permit Cost | Verified cost information | "$75/hour" or "Free with reservation" |
| Permit Details | How to apply, lead time, contact info | "Apply through Parks Dept, 2 weeks advance" |
| Rules & Restrictions | What's prohibited or required | "No drones, tripods OK, no flash indoors" |
| Seasonal Availability | When location is accessible/optimal | "Open April-October, sunflowers peak mid-August" |
| Insider Tips | Local photographer knowledge | "Hidden garden behind main building" |
| Vibe/Style Tags | Aesthetic descriptors | Urban, Natural, Historic, Intimate |
| Location Type | Category of venue | Park, Garden, Urban, Historic Building |

**Business Model**

PhotoVault is a SaaS platform:

| Revenue Stream | Who Pays | Amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Photographer subscription | Photographers | $22/month |
| Year 1 gallery access | Clients | Photographer sets price |
| Year 2+ renewal | Clients | $8/month (50% to photographer) |

The directory is free and public—it drives photographer signups.
