# PhotoVault - Full Context for AI Agents

> Memory Insurance for families. Passive income for photographers.

PhotoVault solves two problems:

1. **For Families**: Professional photos get lost when hard drives fail, cloud storage expires, or gallery links stop working. PhotoVault is "Memory Insurance"—permanent storage managed by their photographer.

2. **For Photographers**: Gallery platforms charge monthly fees but don't generate revenue. PhotoVault flips the model: photographers earn $4/month passive income on every client who renews.

## Part 1: Photo Storage Platform (Memory Insurance)

### The Problem We Solve

Professional photos are expensive to create but cheap to lose:
- Wedding photography: $2,000-5,000 average cost
- Hard drive failure rate: 100% (eventually)
- Professional data recovery: $500-5,000
- Google Photos policy change (2021): Ended unlimited free storage
- Typical gallery expiration: 1 year

Families invest thousands in professional photography, then store the results on hardware that will fail.

### The Memory Insurance Solution

| Feature | Traditional Cloud | PhotoVault |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Permanent storage | No (policies change) | Yes |
| Photographer managed | No | Yes |
| One-tap to camera roll | No (zip files) | Yes |
| Family sharing | Complex | Built-in |
| Cost | $10-15/month | $8/month |
