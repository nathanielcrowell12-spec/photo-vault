Hey [Name],

I'm building PhotoVault - a professional photo gallery platform for photographers. You get beautiful, shareable galleries to deliver photos to clients, plus you keep 50% of what they pay for ongoing storage.

I'm looking for 15-20 photographers to test it before public launch. As a founding photographer, you'd get:

- **$0 for 12 months** (normally $22/month)
- **$22/month locked forever** after that - immune to any future price increases
- **Direct line to me** for feedback and support

What I need from you:
1. Upload at least one real gallery
2. Invite at least one real client (they pay real money - you keep 50%)
3. Tell me what's broken or confusing

Interested? Sign up at **photovault.photo** and use coupon code **PHOTOVAULT_BETA_2026** when you subscribe.

Happy to answer any questions.

— Nate
