## Login & Account Issues

### "Invalid email or password"

**Try these steps:**
1. Double-check your email address for typos
2. Make sure Caps Lock is off
3. Try the "Forgot Password" link to reset
4. Check if you signed up with a different email

### "Email already registered"

This means an account exists with that email. Try:
1. Click "Forgot Password" to reset and regain access
2. Check if you previously created an account

### Password reset email not arriving

**Check these:**
1. Look in your Spam/Junk folder
2. Search for "PhotoVault" in all mail folders
3. Add `noreply@photovault.photo` to your contacts
4. Wait 5 minutes and try again
5. Try a different email if you have one

### Logged out unexpectedly

Sessions expire for security. Simply log back in. If this happens frequently:
1. Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser
2. Don't use "private" or "incognito" mode
3. Clear your browser cache and try again

## Upload Problems (Photographers)

### Upload stuck at 0%

**Try these fixes:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a smaller file first to test
3. Disable VPN if using one
4. Try a different browser
5. Use the Desktop App for large files

### Upload fails partway through

**For large uploads, use the Desktop App** - it handles interruptions gracefully.

If using web upload:
1. Check your internet stability
2. Try uploading fewer files at once
3. Make sure files are under 100MB each for web upload

### "File type not supported"

**Supported formats:**
- JPEG / JPG
- PNG
- HEIC

**Not yet supported:**
- RAW files (CR2, NEF, ARW, etc.) - coming soon
- TIFF
- PSD

Convert unsupported files to JPEG before uploading.

### Photos not appearing after upload

Processing can take a few minutes for large batches. If photos don't appear after 10 minutes:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check the gallery - photos may be there but not showing in the preview
3. Try uploading again
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### ZIP file won't upload

For ZIP uploads, use the **Desktop App**:
1. Download from [photovault.photo/download](https://photovault.photo/download)
2. Install and sign in
3. Select your gallery
4. Drag and drop the ZIP file
