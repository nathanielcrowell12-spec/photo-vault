## About PhotoVault

### What is PhotoVault?

PhotoVault is a professional photo delivery and storage platform. Your photographer uses PhotoVault to deliver your photos, and you get permanent access to view, download, and share them.

### Why does my photographer use PhotoVault?

PhotoVault helps photographers:
- Deliver photos quickly and professionally
- Provide you with permanent, secure storage
- Ensure your photos are never lost

### Is PhotoVault just for professional photos?

PhotoVault is designed for professional photography (weddings, portraits, events), but once you have an account, you can also upload your own personal photos for safekeeping.
