The Shot:
Famous colorful sunburst chairs, Lake Mendota backdrop, sailboats, classic Wisconsin summer feel. Highly Instagrammable.

Permit Requirements:
NO COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY ALLOWED
THIS IS THE BIG ONE: UW-Madison has a strict policy. If you're shooting with a paying client, campus police will ask you to leave.

The Reality:
You can shoot here with friends/family for personal use. But if it's a paid session (engagement, senior, wedding), they WILL stop you. Multiple photographers report being kicked out mid-shoot.

- Or get a UW Special Events permit ($150+, 2-week lead time)
- Contact: Union South Events (608-890-3000)

The "Gotcha":
Photographers get burned by this constantly. Every "best Madison photo spots" list includes the Terrace, but none mention the commercial policy. Don't be that photographer.

Best Times (if you CAN shoot here):
